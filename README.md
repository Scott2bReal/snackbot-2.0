## Description

Re-write of the famous [Discord SNACKBOT](https://github.com/Scott2bReal/discord-snackbot). Attempting to reduce tech debt and learn some new tech

## Getting Started

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Scott2bReal/snackbot-2.0
```

2. Install dependencies using `pnpm`

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Copy the existing `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the required
   values. Hit me up to be added as an application tester for the Discord
   application (the bot)

### Contributing

Create a new branch with the following naming convention: `[your name]/[feature name]`

For example, if I was working on a new feature to add a new command, I would
create a branch called `scott/new-command`

When you have a feature ready to be merged, create a pull request and assign me as a reviewer
